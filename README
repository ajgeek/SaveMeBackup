Backup for minecraft.
Supports daily and hourly backups.
Daily at a specified time (GMT) and hourly on a schedule.
Copies are kept on a rolling basis.
Each backup contains the files and folders included in the config.

Can also be run from the console or as an op player.
    /savemebackup hourly|daily

When run it forces a save and disables autosave.
Autosave is turned back on after completion.

Sample config:

save: save/saveme-hourly.zip            # Name of hourly save file
keep: 3                                 # Number of histories to keep of the hourly (.1, .2, .3 in this example)
frequency: 60m                          # Hourly frequency (###s, ###m, ###h supported)
saveday: save/saveme-daily.zip          # Daily save file
keepday: 3                              # Number of daily histories to keep
daily-at: "12:15:00"                    # Daily schedule, in GMT.  This is actually managed as tics from the server startup
